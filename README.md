# Description

This project provides a helper function for managing Myanmar NRC (National Registration Card) formats, specifically focusing on township codes used across different states and districts. The nrc.php file contains a structured JSON-like list of NRC prefixes, including English transliterations and Myanmar script. It is designed for use in CodeIgniter applications and helps standardize identification formats based on township and state.

Contributors are encouraged to suggest updates or add missing NRC codes to keep the data accurate and up-to-date.
